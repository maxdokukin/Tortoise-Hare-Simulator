# Tortoise and the Hare Simulation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2iKs1e_KX0

This project is a console-based simulation of the classic race between the Tortoise and the Hare. The program models each racer with unique movement patterns: the Tortoise moves steadily but with occasional slips, while the Hare alternates between fast hops, slips, and naps. Each racer's position is updated in real-time, and the race is visually displayed using ASCII art in the terminal. The goal is for either racer to reach or surpass the finish line at position 70, with a dynamic race experience influenced by randomness.

The program includes a countdown timer before the race, an ongoing timer during the race, and displays the results at the end. Both racers are represented with simple ASCII drawings, and their progress across a 90-unit track is shown as the race unfolds. If the Tortoise and Hare collide on the same position, a special message ("OUCH!") is displayed. The race continues until one or both racers finish, and a winner or tie is announced. No external dependencies are required, making this project a simple and fun C++ console simulation.
